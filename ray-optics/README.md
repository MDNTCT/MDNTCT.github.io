# Ray Optics Simulation
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6386611.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6386611)

A web app for creating and simulating 2D geometric optical scenes. Our goal is to make it easy for students to build physical intuition by "playing around", for teachers to do dynamical demonstrations, and at the same time also include tools for more advanced usage.

## Features
- Simulate various light sources: ray, beam, and point source
- Simulate reflection in linear, circular, and parabolic mirror
- Simulate beam splitter
- Simulate refraction in linear or circular interfaces, including both refracted and reflected rays
- Simulate mixture of colors and chromatic dispersion  
- Simulate ideal lens/mirror, which obeys lens/mirror equation
- View extensions of rays to see if they converge to a virtual image
- View real images, virtual images, and virtual objects directly
- View images that can be observed from some given position
- Distance, angular, energy flow, and momentum flow measurements
- Export as SVG diagram
